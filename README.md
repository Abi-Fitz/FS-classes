# Classes

In this repository, you will practice writing classes.

## Objectives

  - Create and use classes.
  - Write unit tests.

## Setup

Run `yarn` to install packages.
Run `yarn test` to run tests.

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Get comfortable with the testing framework
  - [ ] Spend approximately 20-30 minutes reading the [Chai documentation](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) - focus on the `expect/should` page.
  - [ ] Read all of the test in `_animals.js` and make sure you understand them.
  - [ ] Get all of the animal tests to pass.
  - [ ] Check in with your instructor before moving on!

### 2. Complete the rest of the classes in the `src` folder, passing and adding tests as you go.
  - [ ] Complete the Dog class in `dog.js`.
    - There are 3 bugs in the test file for this class that you will have to fix.
  - [ ] Complete the Poodle class in `poodle.js`.
    - You will have to write tests for this class.
  - [ ] Complete the Cat class in `cat.js`.
    - You will have to write test for this class.
  - [ ] Create a totally new class called "Bird". 
    - Create a new file for the class.
      - Don't forget to export it!
    - Create a new file for tests.
      - Don't forget to import the Bird class into this file.
      - Write quality tests.

### 3. Commit early, commit often!
  - [ ] After each major change, make a commit to Github. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) for commands and tips for writing good commit messages.
    - `git status` checks for changes (optional)
    - `git add .` adds all files 
    - `git commit -m"MESSAGE"` adds commit message
    - `git push` pushes changes
