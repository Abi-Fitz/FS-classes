# Classes

In this repository, you will practice writing classes.

## Objectives

  - Create and use classes.
  - Write unit tests.

## Setup

Run `yarn` to install packages.
Run `yarn test` to run tests.

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Complete all of the questions in the `src` folder.
  - [ ] Open the `src` folder.
    - Finish creating the classes in this order:
      - `animal.js`
      - `dog.js`
      - `poodle.js`
      - `cat.js`

### 2. Run tests
  - [ ] Pass all tests associated with each class.
    - Run `yarn test` in your terminal to run tests. 
  - [ ] Add tests where required.
    - Learn more about using [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) for testing here.

### 3. Commit early, commit often!
  - [ ] After each major change, make a commit to Github. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) for commands and tips for writing good commit messages.
    - `git status` checks for changes (optional)
    - `git add .` adds all files 
    - `git commit -m"MESSAGE"` adds commit message
    - `git push` pushes changes
